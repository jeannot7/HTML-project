          I can safely say that i am a coding addict 😂😂😂. <br />
          Here you gonna find the gist of my work. <br />
          Enjoy !

        <h2>
          Here is a presentation of some of my best projects so far. Have a look
          !
        </h2>
        <h2>WILOOD</h2>
        <div class="wilood">
          <p>
            Wilood is a music streaming app for kids. <br />
            I built it in three months for the startup "tech by Wiloo". <br />
            This startup is the leading child-tech-products maker in the world.

        <h2>Auntie's Burger</h2>
        <div class="aunties--burger">
          <p>
            Bit hungry ? What about trying auntie's bugers ? <br />
            Auntie's Burger is the best burger restaurant in town. <br />
            Their burgers have the most delightful taste. <br />
            I made their entire Website. <br />
            It is very useful in getting them clients and enables the food
            delivery service
          </p>

        </div>
        <h2>Baby Laughs</h2>
        <div class="baby--laughs">
          <p>
            Videos of babies laughing are always the best antidepressants. Agree
            ? 😂 Jason Jones had this wonderful idea of <br />
            creating a baby laugh youtube videos compilation app. <br />
            Unfortunately, not being a developer he could not build it on his
            own. <br />
            That's were i came in 😎.
